# TrainerHub Local Development - Hosts File Setup

If you want to use subdomain-based routing (recommended for production-like experience),
add these entries to your /etc/hosts file:

## Manual Setup (requires sudo)
sudo tee -a /etc/hosts > /dev/null << 'EOF'

# TrainerHub Local Development Domains
127.0.0.1    trainerhubb.local
127.0.0.1    www.trainerhubb.local
127.0.0.1    app.trainerhubb.local
127.0.0.1    app.localhost
EOF

## Alternative: Simple Port-Based Development
If you can't modify /etc/hosts, use the port-based setup instead:

- Django (Landing): http://localhost:8000
- React (Dashboard): http://localhost:3000

The run_local.sh script handles this automatically.

## Testing the Setup

1. Run: ./run_local.sh
2. Visit: http://localhost:8000
3. Click "Get Started" → React modal appears
4. Register/Login → Redirects to http://localhost:3000/dashboard

## Troubleshooting

If you get DNS errors:
1. Check if hosts entries are correct
2. Try using IP directly: http://127.0.0.1:8000
3. Use the port-based setup as fallback

For production deployment, the subdomain setup will work automatically.
